I am a Self Driven iOS developer. I have tought myself C back in high school.

Though I know how to code, I didn't really start my journey until I added several features to Pioneers, an open sourceÂ emulation of the board game The Settlers of Catan.

When I worked for Samsung as a Photolithograph technician, I wanted to do something productive when I was on standby just incase something breaks. I used this time to develop a program to automate some basic tasks that I was doing, such as pulling files from ASML tools. I shared this with the team and they game me a praise award for it.
